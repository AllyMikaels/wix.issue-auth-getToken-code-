# wix.issue-auth-getToken-code-
I am having trouble figuring out the problem I am running into, The specific problem WIX is feeding me is "Cannot read property 'code' of undefined". What I am trying to do with the website is have a google sign-in where only a specific domain will work (@gbccs.org), and I am using OAuth 2.0.
