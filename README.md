# wix.issue-auth-getToken-code-
I am having trouble figuring out the problem I am running into, The specific problem WIX is feeding me is "Cannot read property 'code' of undefined". What I am trying to do with the website is have a google sign-in where only a specific domain will work (@gbccs.org), and I am using OAuth 2.0.  Most of the pages to the website is not published, if that is the reason for the errors I am receiving then it would help if you could let me know in some sort of comment. Any help is much appreciated, thank you ^_^
